# <Stumble-Upon-the-Force>

## Description

**Stumble upon the Force** Is a webpage that contains two parts; a random trivia generator and a translator that translates any phrase into a yoda-style sentence. Yoda is one of the iconic characters from the series, known for his unique style of speaking. We're builing this project to teach people facts about Star Wars, including one of our own team members. This should help people new to the series learn more about different aspects of the series, such as trivia on characters, planets, spaceships, and other such topics in the series.
